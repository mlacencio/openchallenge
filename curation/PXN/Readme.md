<H2>Diagram showing the step-by-step assembly of the paxillin protein with RAF, MEK and ERK</H2>

All reactions were extracted from PMID:14636584 and all of them were experimentally demonstrated (ECO:0000269). The results were obtained with the mouse inner medullary collecting duct (mIMCD-3) epithelial cells (CL_1000547). All entities are from mouse, but the names displayed refer to human proteins.
